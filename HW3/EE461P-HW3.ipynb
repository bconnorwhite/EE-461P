Your class should take as input the learning_rate, regularization_constant and number of epochs. The fit method must take as input X,y and a choice of update_rule as 'SGD' or 'adagrad' (Notes on implementation below). The _predict_ method takes an X value (optionally, an array of values).

Plot MSE and the $w$ parameters as a function of epoch count (10 epochs) for the best 2 combinations of learning_rate and regularization for both SGD and Adagrad. ie you should have 2 plots of MSE and parameter updates for SGD and adagrad each.

    "Adagrad (http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) differs from vanilla SGD in that the learning rate of each weight changes over updates. A cache is maintained that holds the sum of squares of all gradients upto the current update. The learning_rate is divided by the cache, resulting in a different learning rate for each weight. A consequence of this update rule is that weights that have already seen large gradients (made large jumps) make smaller updates in subsequent iterations.\n",
